# Lubricant-Project
This project develops an AI system to predict the degradation of lubricants (oh_od) and their impact on machinery performance, enabling timely maintenance interventions to enhance efficiency and reduce costs in industrial applications.

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for feature engineering and model comparison related to lubricant performance.

## Files

* **Lubricant_FeatureEngineering.ipynb:** This notebook describes the process of feature engineering for the lubricant dataset.
* **Lubricant_ModelComparison.ipynb:** This notebook compares different models for predicting lubricant performance. 
* **Updated NN.ipynb:** This notebook contains an updated neural network implementation 
* **final_lubricant.csv:** The final processed lubricant data used for modeling.
* **final Model Output.pbix:** This Power BI file  visualizes the final model output.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks in this repository, you'll need to:
1. Install Jupyter Notebook and any required libraries (mentioned in the notebooks).
2. Download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

## Additional Notes
* Feel free to modify the notebooks and file structure to suit your specific needs.
* Consider adding comments and explanations to your code for better readability.
* You can version control your project using Git for tracking changes.

I hope this helps!
